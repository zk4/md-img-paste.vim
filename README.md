# md-img-paste.vim
Yet simple tool to paste images into markdown files

## Use Case
You are editing a markdown file and have an image on the clipboard and want to paste it into the document as the text `![](img/image1.png)`. Instead of first copying it to that directory, you want to do it with a single `<leader>p` key press in Vim. So it hooks `<leader>p`, checks if you are editing a Markdown file, saves the image from the clipboard to the location  `img/image1.png`, and inserts `![](img/image1.png)` into the file.

## Installation

Using Vundle
```
Plugin 'zk4/md-img-paste.vim'
```

## Usage
Add to .vimrc
```
autocmd FileType markdown nmap <silent> <leader>p :call mdip#MarkdownClipboardImage()<CR>
" there are some defaults for image directory and image name, you can change them
" let g:mdip_imgdir = 'img'
" let g:mdip_imgname = 'image'
```
